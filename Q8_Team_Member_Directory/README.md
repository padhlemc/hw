# Team Member Directory (Reusable React Components)
> **Roll Numbers:** Special Roll / Syllabus Q2  
> **Backend Port:** `5008`  
> **Database:** MongoDB (`team_directory_db`) via Native `MongoClient` Driver (with Offline JSON Fallback)  
> **Frontend:** React 18 (Component State, Hooks, Modern UI)

## 📌 Problem Statement
View team members with name, photo, job title, bio, and skills. Built with reusable React components passing member details via props (<Navbar />, <FilterBar />, <TeamCard />, <MemberModal />). Features both Vite setup and standalone execution.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Method 1: Quick 2-Step Run (Recommended for Exams)
Run both frontend and backend seamlessly together on **Port 5008**:

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to the question folder
cd Q8_Team_Member_Directory

# Step 2: Install dependencies (optional if node_modules is pre-installed)
npm install

# Step 3: Start the full-stack application
npm start
# (or: npm run dev)
```

Now open your browser at:
👉 **`http://localhost:5008`**

---

### Method 2: Running Frontend & Backend Separately

#### 1. Start the Backend Server:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
*Backend runs at `http://localhost:5008` serving REST API endpoints on `/api/...`.*

#### 2. Open the Frontend:
- Open `frontend/index.html` directly in your browser, **OR**
- Run a live server in the `frontend` folder:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npx serve . -p 3000
  ```
*The frontend automatically connects to `http://localhost:5008/api` with CORS enabled!*

## 🗄️ MongoDB Native Driver Details
- **Driver:** Official `mongodb` Node.js driver (`MongoClient`, `ObjectId`)
- **Connection URI:** `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`
- **Database Name:** `team_directory_db`
- **Collections:** `members`
- **Offline Fallback:** If MongoDB is not running locally in your lab, the server automatically saves data to `data_fallback.json`. You will never get an unhandled database crash!
